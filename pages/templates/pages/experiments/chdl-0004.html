      <h2>TL;DR</h2>
      <p>Create a line chart that correlates the number of works by Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms performed each year at Carnegie Hall.</p>
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-light" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#verbose"><h2>- verbose</h2></button>
      <div id="verbose" class="collapse"><br>
        <p>Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Johannes Brahms are sometimes playfully referred to as the “Three Bs” of classical music. The nearly 130-year history of Carnegie Hall presents and interesting opportunity to examine changes in popularity for these composers that now command such a central position in the classical music canon.</p>
        <p>Rationale: a single concert might include performances of more than one work by any one of these composers, e.g. an “All-Beethoven” concert featuring several piano sonatas. The scope encompasses any work written by Bach, Beethoven, or Brahms (including portions of works, e.g. a performance of only one movement from a sonata) performed each year at CH from the first performances at the Hall in 1891 until July 1, 2019 (the most recent update of data on data.carnegiehall.org).</p>
        <div id="lab_report-methods">
          <h2>METHODS</h2>
          <p>We created a SPARQL query to count the number of each composer’s works performed each year:</p>
          <!-- SPARQL query goes in this section -->
          <!-- be sure to escape the "&lt;http:" in prefixes with "&lt;http:" -->
          <div  class="bg-light text-dark" id="lab_report-query">
            <!-- Be careful, "<" and ">" may need to be escaped with "&lt;" and "&gt;" -->
            <!-- Quotes may also need to be escaped with "&quot;" -->
            <pre><code>
              PREFIX chnames: &lt;http://data.carnegiehall.org/names/&gt;
              PREFIX dcterms: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/terms/&gt;
              PREFIX event: &lt;http://purl.org/NET/c4dm/event.owl#&gt;
              PREFIX foaf: &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&gt;
              SELECT ?yearOfEvent (COUNT(DISTINCT ?workPerf) AS ?numberOfWorks)
              WHERE {
                ?work dcterms:creator chnames:1003166 .
                ?event dcterms:date ?date
                       BIND (str(YEAR(?date)) AS ?yearOfEvent)
                ?event event:product ?workPerf .
                ?workPerf event:product ?work
              }
              GROUP BY ?yearOfEvent
              ORDER BY ?yearOfEvent
            </code></pre>
          </div>
          <p>The query was run three times, substituting to appropriate identifier for each composer in the first line of the WHERE clause:</p>
          <div  class="bg-light text-dark" id="lab_report-query">
            <!-- Be careful, "<" and ">" may need to be escaped with "&lt;" and "&gt;" -->
            <!-- Quotes may also need to be escaped with "&quot;" -->
            <pre><code>
              ?work dcterms:creator chnames:1003166  (Bach)
              ?work dcterms:creator chnames:1005833  (Beethoven)
              ?work dcterms:creator chnames:1004316  (Brahms)
            </code></pre>
          </div>
          <p>We then created a Google Sheet using the query results, added a Smooth Line chart to visualize the data, and created an embed link for the chart to use on our Data Lab site.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="lab_report-conclusions">
          <h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>
          <p><strong>what we learned</strong></p>
          <p>Google Charts are very easy to create, and with the embed option they provide an out-of-the-box tool to make nice data visualizations with no special development skills.</p>
          <p><strong>further investigation</strong></p>
          <p>Using Google Sheets/Charts for visualizations requires hosting the data in a personal Google Drive account. Ideally, we’d like to learn how to use a tool like D3.js to create chart visualizations on our own without having to host the data files externally.</p>
          <p>Another option: we currently use Ontotext’s GraphDB for our RDF data. GraphDB’s Workbench user interface offers several data display options, including the ability to create a Google Chart .svg file directly from the UI. Adding the .svg file to our Data Lab site could provide a more direct method for visualization with a shallower learning curve than D3.js.</p>
